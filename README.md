# On My Grind

## Description

Have you ever wanted to work at Starbucks? You're about to be one step closer. In this app inspired by Wordle, memorize coffee drink recipes and quiz yourself on a random real (and possibly discontinued ðŸ˜‰) Starbucks drink's temperature, flavor, milk type, and blendedness. The app will let you know if you're a natural at barista-ing.
